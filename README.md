# 3DOF_FK
Calculating Forward Kinematics of a 3-DOF Robot Manipulator (RRR) in C 

Includes a Robot structure for a theoretical 3 degrees of freedom robot manipulator with all rotational joints, and a forward kinematics function which returns the end effector position based on the given joint parameters.
